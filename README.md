Application: Priority Task Manager
1. Introduction: The Priority Task Manager is a Java console application that leverages a heap data structure to manage tasks based on their priorities. Tasks with the highest priority are processed first, which is essential for scenarios where certain tasks need immediate attention.

2. What it can do:
Add tasks with a priority value (lower number = higher priority).
View the highest-priority task without removing it.
Remove and process the highest-priority task.
Display all tasks currently in the priority queue.

3.Why this application? Efficient task management is critical in both personal and professional settings. By using a heap, we demonstrate its practical application in solving real-world problems such as scheduling or load balancing. This app contributes by showcasing how fundamental data structures can be used effectively in real-life scenarios.

4. Contribution to the community: This program serves as a learning tool for students and developers interested in understanding and applying heap data structures. It provides a practical use case, making it easier to comprehend abstract concepts and inspiring the development of more advanced systems.
